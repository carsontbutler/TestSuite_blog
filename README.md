# TestSuite_blog
This is a testing framework for a simple blog.

I am currently working on UI tests, after which I plan to deploy the blog itself and add some API tests.

I am designing the framework on my own. The blog was designed by Corey Schafer and can be found at: https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Django_Blog
